            <h3>
                Me :)
            </h3>
            <p>
                I have always enjoyed to travel and discover new places, my dream is to live in another country than Belgium for some time! My preferred cities I visited are Montréal, Stockholm and Copenhagen!<br>
                Besides that, I love sport and have been swimming since I was 3 years old! Nowadays, I mainly support my favorite football team Real Madrid and went to Madrid
                for my 18th birthday.
            </p>
            <img class="image main" src="images/madrid.jpeg" alt="" />
            <p>
                I like to go out and see some friends to party or go for dinner or a movie. <br>
                3 fun facts about me:<br>
                    - I slept outside in Lapland with -16°C <br>
                    - I had lunch with the ambassador of Belgium to Sweden and was invited to the embassy in Stockholm <br>
                    - I almost died 2 times when skiing <br>
            </p>


            <h3>
                Education
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a enthusiastic and optimistic person who always seeks to discover new things and to meet new people. I like to challenge myself and feel so proud when I achieve my goals. <br />
                <br>
                In High School I was studying Latin and ancient Greek but the past was nothing for me but wonderful and interesting stories. What I wanted was to learn what was behind technologies and be part of this
                new era of Internet. I then decided to study Information Technologies and soon realized that there was a huge challenge among us: securing our data and systems. <br />
                <br>
                After a year at Liège University, I decided to go to Haute Ecole Libre Mosane to study cybersecurity and I must say: that was the best choice I made. Once I graduated from my Bachelor,
                I needed to learn more about computer systems, so I decided to pursue my education with a Master degree in Computer Systems Architecture at Haute Ecole Namur-Liège-Luxembourg and Namur University. There I
                have improved my technical and soft skills in project management!
                <br>
                This was not enough for me, I had the opportunity to make one of my oldest dreams come true: living in another country. I went on an exchange in Sweden, at Halmstad University, where I
                had the chance to meet people from around the world and discover scandinavian culture. In fact, the picture above was taken in a fjord in Narvik (Norwegian Lapland) during a trip :). <br>
                <br>
                In my final year, I went for a 10 weeks internship at KPMG Belgium where I made research on cyber threats on crypt wallets. I also wrote a master thesis on IoT security architecture.
